# h2-lpm
Grammar-based HTTP/2 fuzzer built with libprotobuf-mutator.

I made this to learn about libfuzzer and libprotobuf-mutator, while also getting some understanding of the nginx codebase.

Check the other branch "nginx-harness" to see how it can be used in practice. Harness code is largely borrowed from oss-fuzz.
